# ECE361_HW5

This Git repository contains all of my work for HW5.

There is a folder containing some github transcripts from when I was pushing 
my code files into the repository. There are also 2 folders containing the 
work for the homework assignment.

HW5P1+2 Contains the binary search tree API, a test program to run it,
a makefile to build everything, and exe file, and a transcript of a successful run

HW5P3-7 Contains an iom361 test program that utilizes the BST, iom361, and float_rndm 
APIs to generate random temp and humidity values for 1 month and stores them in a 
binary search tree. This file contains all source files and .o files as well as
an exe, makefile, and transcript of a successful run.
